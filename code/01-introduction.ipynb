    "In the past year, retail investors have flocked to the stock and cryptocurrency markets in the hopes of netting a handsome return on their investments. While they were present long before the COVID-19 pandemic, their participation and impact on the markets have grown in recent months. From playing an active role in short-squeezing GME's stock to creating hype around dogecoin, retail investors have engaged in numerous types of trading activity with a wide-ranging level of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investments and trades made in the stock and crypto markets both assume some level of risk. Given the wildly volatile nature of cryptocurrency, I consider cryptocurrencies to have a higher risk profile than stocks for the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The r/wallstreetbets subreddit is a community of 9.4 million members who seek to make money by investing and trading in the stock market. The r/SatoshiStreetBets subreddit is the cryptocurrency equivalent of r/wallstreetbets with a smaller community of 347K members. While r/wallstreetbets mostly focuses on the stock market and r/SatoshiStreetBets mainly engages with the cryptocurrency market, conversations in both subreddits do occasionally overlap with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, my goal is two-fold: (1) I aim to build a classification model that can predict if a post came from r/wallstreetbets or r/SatoshiStreetBets with a minimum accuracy of 50% and an ideal accuracy of 80% or higher and (2) I plan to identify words unique to each subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist consulting Reddit to provide cautionary warnings on its r/wallstreetbets and r/SatoshiStreetBets subreddits, I hope to determine the keywords unique to each subreddit."
